## 7 step approach to solving any programming problem

1) Work an instance yourself

2) Write down what you did

3) Write down specific patterns of what you did - Generalize

4) Write an algorithm

5) Write code

6) Test code

## Working with shapes

There I have developed a class ```PerimeterAssignmentRunner```. It contains multiple methods.

1) ```getPerimeter``` calculates the perimeter of the given Shape (A class of points).
2) ```getNumPoints``` Returns the number of points in a shape.
3) ```getAverageLength```, ```getLargestSide```, and ```getLargestX``` allow to find additional information about the shape.
4) ```getLargestPerimeterMultipleFiles``` Returns the largest perimeter when multiple shapes (files) are given.
5) ```getFileWithLargestPerimeter``` Returns the filename with the largest perimeter of a shape.

## Finding youtube links

In this small project, I developed a simple parser that prints all Youtube links from a web page. 

## Finding genes in the DNA
### Simplified DNA concepts
The DNA can be represented as a string of Nucleotides (A, G, T, C). 3 Nucleotides form a Codon. A gene starts with ATG - a Start Codon. A gene can end with one of these 3 stop codons: TAA, TGA, TAG.
